I have created this repository as a way to track my progress in learning NumPy software, so that I can start making ML models in Python,
This repository is made for eduxational purposes. Feel free to download the ZIP file if you want to learn NumPy in a quick and easy way.

NumPy is a library in Python that is used to work on arrays. NumPy can also help us work in other domains like linear algebra or matrices.
NumPy is an essential tool in the field of Data Science.

Arrays are better than the lists in Python because they are much faster. Speed and efficiency is essential in Data Science.
